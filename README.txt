This is a continuation of the blob vehicle parts from a contribution known as blazemod from the game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.
It will retain this separation until it has been reworked into a fuller experience worthy of being an available mod in the main experience the average player is exposed to by simply downloading CDDA.
It is expected that features may be added and removed at will, and there will be no further effort to retain savegame stability until re-introduced back into the game's own files once more.
